Java is object oriented. Unchanged C++ or C code will not work in Java, in most cases, though Java looks much like C and C++.

Java can run on many different operating systems. This makes Java platform independent. Java does this by making the Java compiler turn code into Java bytecode instead of machine code. This means that when the program is executed, the Java Virtual Machine interprets the bytecode and translates it into machine code.

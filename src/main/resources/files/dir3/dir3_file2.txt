Kotlin is a statically typed programming language that runs on the Java virtual machine and also can be compiled to JavaScript source code or use the LLVM compiler infrastructure. Its primary development is from a team of JetBrains programmers based in Saint Petersburg, Russia.[2] While the syntax is not compatible with Java, the JVM implementation of Kotlin's standard library is designed to interoperate with Java code and is reliant on Java code from the existing Java Class Library, such as the collections framework[3]. Kotlin uses aggressive type inference to determine the type of values and expressions for which type has been left unstated. This reduces language verbosity relative to Java, which demands often entirely redundant type specifications prior to version 10.

As of Android Studio 3.0 (October 2017) Kotlin is a fully supported programming language by Google on the Android Operating System[4], and is directly included in the Android Studio 3.0 IDE package as an alternative to the standard Java compiler. The Android Kotlin compiler lets the user choose between targeting Java 6- or Java 8-compatible bytecode.[5]
